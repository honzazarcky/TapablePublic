        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

        <h2>3. Location &amp; Health Data</h2>
        <p>The App requests access to your device's location services and health data (via Apple HealthKit) to provide its core features. By granting these permissions, you acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GPS data is collected to track and display your running routes, pace, distance, and elevation.</li>
            <li>Background location access may be used to continue tracking when the screen is locked.</li>
            <li>Health data (steps, walking/running distance) is read from Apple Health for display within the App only.</li>
            <li>You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings, which may limit App functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. AI Coaching</h2>
        <p>The App may provide AI-generated coaching suggestions based on your running history. These recommendations are for informational purposes only and do not constitute medical, health, or professional fitness advice. Always consult a qualified professional before starting or modifying any exercise program.</p>

        <h2>5. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
        <p>Certain features of the App may require a paid subscription. If applicable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store according to their respective terms.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
            <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription through your device's store settings.</li>
            <li>Refunds are subject to the policies of the applicable app store.</li>
        </ul>

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works based on the App without our prior written consent.</p>

        <h2>7. User Content</h2>
        <p>Any data you create within the App (run records, targets, notes) remains yours. By using the App, you grant us a limited license to process and store this data solely for the purpose of providing and improving the App's services.</p>

        <h2>8. Prohibited Conduct</h2>

            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorised access to the App's systems or other users' accounts.</li>
            <li>Use the App to transmit harmful, abusive, or illegal content.</li>

            <li>Use automated tools (bots, scrapers) to interact with the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.</li>

        <p>You use the App at your own risk, including during outdoor physical activity.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tapable shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to personal injury, data loss, or loss of profits, regardless of the cause of action.</p>

        <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>

        <h2>12. Modifications</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated through the App or our website. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately. Sections relating to intellectual property, limitation of liability, and indemnification survive termination.</p>

        <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the App shall be resolved through binding arbitration or in the courts of competent jurisdiction.</p>
