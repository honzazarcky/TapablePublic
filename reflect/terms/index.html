        </ul>

        <h2>5. User Accounts and Data</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1 Account Creation</strong></p>
        <p>You must create an account to use the App. You can sign in using Apple, Google, or Facebook. Your account is managed through our authentication provider (Clerk). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

        <p><strong>5.2 User Data</strong></p>
        <p>You retain all rights to any content you create within the App (such as decisions, notes, and reflections). Decisions are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers. By using the App, you grant us a license to process your data as described in our <a href="/reflect/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>5.3 Data Backup</strong></p>
        <p>You may export your decisions as a JSON file and import them on another device. You are responsible for the security of exported backup files. We do not access or store your backup files.</p>

        <p><strong>5.4 Accuracy of Information</strong></p>
        <p>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during account registration and to update such information to maintain its accuracy.</p>

        <h2>6. AI Features</h2>
        <p><strong>6.1 AI-Generated Content</strong></p>
        <p>The App uses artificial intelligence to generate reflection questions and weekly insights based on your decision data. By using AI features, you acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI-generated content is for informational and reflective purposes only.</li>
            <li>AI responses may not always be accurate, complete, or suitable for your situation.</li>
            <li>Decision metadata (title, category, mood, outcome) is sent to our backend for AI processing.</li>
            <li>AI-generated content should not be considered professional advice of any kind (financial, medical, legal, or otherwise).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>6.2 Not Professional Advice</strong></p>
        <p>The App is not intended to provide professional, medical, financial, legal, or therapeutic advice. AI reflection questions and insights are tools to support your personal decision-making process. Always seek the advice of qualified professionals for important life decisions.</p>

        <h2>7. Premium Subscriptions</h2>
        <p><strong>7.1 Subscription Terms</strong></p>
        <p>Certain features of the App require a paid subscription ("Reflect Pro"). Subscriptions are processed through Apple's App Store or Google Play Store, subject to their respective terms and conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>7.2 Free Tier Limits</strong></p>
        <p>The free tier includes limited decision history and limited AI usage per week. Reflect Pro removes these limits and unlocks additional features including weekly AI insights.</p>

        <p><strong>7.3 Payment</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscriptions are charged to your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account.</li>
            <li>Payment will be charged upon confirmation of purchase.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription through your App Store or Play Store account settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>7.4 Changes to Pricing</strong></p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change subscription pricing at any time. For existing subscribers, we will provide notice before any price increase takes effect. Price changes will not apply to your current subscription period if you purchased before the change.</p>
