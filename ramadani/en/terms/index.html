        <h2>7. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p><strong>7.1 Ownership</strong></p>
        <p>The App, including all content, features, functionality, software, design, text, graphics, logos, and underlying technology, is owned by Tapable and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.</p>
        <p><strong>7.2 Islamic Content</strong></p>
        <p>Duaas, Quranic content, and the 99 Names of Allah included in the App are sourced from established Islamic texts and traditions. Transliterations and translations are provided for accessibility and convenience.</p>
        <p><strong>7.3 User-Generated Content</strong></p>
        <p>You retain full ownership of data you create in the App (prayer logs, tasbih sessions, favorites, bookmarks). This content is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly opt into cloud backup.</p>
        <p><strong>7.4 Trademarks</strong></p>
        <p>"Ramadani" and associated logos are trademarks of Tapable. You may not use these trademarks without prior written permission.</p>

        <h2>8. Religious Content Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>8.1 Not Religious Authority</strong></p>
        <p>THE APP IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE QUALIFIED ISLAMIC SCHOLARS, LOCAL MOSQUES, OR RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES. The content provided is for informational and devotional purposes only and should not be considered a religious ruling (fatwa) or substitute for consultation with qualified scholars.</p>
        <p><strong>8.2 Accuracy of Calculations</strong></p>
        <p>While we strive for accuracy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prayer times are calculated using established algorithms (Muslim World League, ISNA, Egyptian, Umm al-Qura, etc.) and may vary slightly from times announced by local mosques or authorities.</li>
            <li>Qibla direction is determined using your device's compass and GPS, and may be affected by magnetic interference, device calibration, or environmental factors.</li>
            <li>Hijri calendar dates are calculated algorithmically and may differ from dates based on moon sighting in your region.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>8.3 Consult Scholars</strong></p>
        <p>Always seek the guidance of qualified Islamic scholars for matters of religious rulings, jurisprudence, and spiritual guidance. The App is a tool to support your worship, not a replacement for scholarly guidance.</p>

        <h2>9. Location &amp; Sensor Data</h2>
        <p>The App requests access to your device's location services and motion sensors to provide its core features. By granting these permissions, you acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GPS data is used to calculate prayer times and Qibla direction.</li>
            <li>Compass/magnetometer data is used to display real-time Qibla direction.</li>
            <li>Location data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
            <li>You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings, which may limit App functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
